his mother's brother's daughter, matrilateral cross cousin,
father's sister's daughter, patrilateral cross cousin, or
under special circumstances, a relative who is simultaneously his mother's brother's and father's sister's daughter, bilateral cross cousin.
The same relationships would of course obtain for a female ego. However, cross cousin marriage rules per se are specified from a male perspective. Thus for matrilateral cross cousin marriage, a man marries his mother's brother's daughter, although his wife is marrying patrilaterally, i.e., to her father's sister's son. In the patrilateral case, a man marries his father's sister's daughter and a woman, her mother's brother's son.
